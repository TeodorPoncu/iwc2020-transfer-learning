<b>Fused Attention Augmented Convolution</b> - https://github.com/leaderj1001/Attention-Augmented-Conv2d <br>
<b>Dataset preprocessing and CSV submission</b> - https://www.kaggle.com/ateplyuk/iwildcam2020-pytorch-start <br>
<b>Dataset</b> - https://github.com/visipedia/iwildcam_comp <br>

Running main.py is sufficient for generating a submission file. Posted training hyperparameters might differ.
